# Leveraged Yield FHE: A Privacy-First DeFi Protocol

Leveraged Yield FHE is a DeFi protocol designed specifically for confidential leveraged yield farming, powered by **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption technology** (FHE). This innovative platform allows users to engage in yield farming while ensuring that their position sizes, leverage ratios, and health metrics remain completely private and secure from adversarial attacks, such as liquidation bots or competing traders.

## Understanding the Pain Point

In the fast-paced DeFi landscape, strategies often become vulnerable. Users face significant risks when revealing sensitive information about their leveraged positions, which can lead to exploitation by malicious entities. The lack of privacy can result in liquidations, losses, and diminished returns for high-risk DeFi players. As the competition intensifies, safeguarding sensitive data isn't just preferable—it's essential.

## The FHE Solution

Leveraged Yield FHE addresses these concerns through the deployment of **Zama's open-source FHE libraries**, such as **Concrete** and the **zama-fhe SDK**. By leveraging fully homomorphic encryption, we can perform computations on encrypted data, allowing for the evaluation of key metrics—like health and liquidation thresholds—without exposing the underlying information. This preserves user privacy while still enabling efficient and accurate data handling.

## Core Functionalities

- **FHE-Encrypted User Positions:** All user leverage positions are securely encrypted, preventing unauthorized access.
- **Homomorphic Calculations:** The protocol allows for the computation of health metrics and liquidation thresholds without compromising user privacy.
- **Privacy Protection for High-Risk Players:** Strategies utilized by users remain confidential, ensuring protection against liquidation bots.
- **User-Friendly Dashboard:** A comprehensive dashboard that simplifies position management for both novice and experienced users.
- **Increased Security:** Enhancements that significantly boost the safety of leveraged yield farming, ensuring peace of mind for participants.

## Technology Stack

- **Zama's FHE SDK**: Core technology enabling encrypted computations.
- **Ethereum Smart Contracts**: Built with Solidity for secure transactions.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building scalable server-side applications.
- **Hardhat**: Development environment for Ethereum software.
- **Ethers.js**: Library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.
- **IPFS**: For decentralized storage of user data in a privacy-centric manner.

## Project Structure

Here’s a glance at the directory structure of the Leveraged Yield FHE protocol:

```
/leveragedYieldFHE
├── contracts
│   └── leveragedYieldFHE.sol
├── scripts
│   ├── deploy.js
│   └── interact.js
├── test
│   └── leveragedYieldFHE.test.js
├── node_modules

└── README.md
```

## Installation Instructions

To set up Leveraged Yield FHE, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- **Node.js** (version 14 or higher)
- **Hardhat** (as a development environment)

After verifying the prerequisites, follow these instructions to get started:

1. Navigate to the project directory.
2. Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies, including Zama's FHE libraries:

```bash
npm install
```

*Note: Do not use `git clone` or any URLs to download the project files.*

## Build & Execute

Once installation is complete, you can build and run the project using these commands:

1. **Compile the Smart Contracts**:

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

2. **Deploy the Contracts**:

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <your_network>
```

3. **Run Tests**:

```bash
npx hardhat test
```

### Example Usage

Here is an example of how to interact with the deployed contract after it has been compiled and deployed:

```javascript
const { ethers } = require("hardhat");

async function main() {
    const leveragedYieldFHE = await ethers.getContractAt("leveragedYieldFHE", "<contract_address>");

    // Example: Check user health using FHE encryption
    const userHealth = await leveragedYieldFHE.getUserHealth(<user_address>);
    console.log(`User Health: ${userHealth.toString()}`);
}

main()
    .then(() => process.exit(0))
    .catch((error) => {
        console.error(error);
        process.exit(1);
    });
```

This snippet demonstrates how to check the health of a user's position while keeping all metrics encrypted.
